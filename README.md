# SchedulePlanner
Plan your classes visually based off of UNC academic advising worksheets or add them in one by one. With each class, specify difficulty so that you can plan a schedule that not only fits all the classes you need to take but also orders them so you never have too overwhelming of a semester. 
I made this Java App for my own personal use on my desktop; however, I later created a web-application that can be found at www.plancarolina.com
